The Assembler Matrix is a multiblock structure. It is a combination of <ItemLink id="ae2:molecular_assembler" /> and <ItemLink id="ae2:pattern_provider" />.
It can run a lot of crafting jobs at the same time (with enough <ItemLink id="ae2:crafting_accelerator" />s in your ME network) and save channels for you.

## Structure

<GameScene zoom="3" background="transparent" interactive={true}>
  <ImportStructure src="../structure/assembler_matrix.snbt"></ImportStructure>
</GameScene>

It is a rectangular prism, with edge lengths between 3 and 7. 
- Edges are composed of Assembler Matrix Frame.
- Faces are composed of Assembler Matrix Wall/Glass.
- The interior is composed of Assembler Matrix Pattern/Craft/Speed Core.

A valid Assembler Matrix must contain at least one pattern core and one craft core.
It must be completely filled and can't be hollow.
When the Assembler Matrix is correctly formed and powered, the lines on the Assembler Matrix Frame will turn blue.

## Assembler Matrix Core

There are 3 different Assembler Matrix Cores.

- Assembler Matrix Pattern Core

The Assembler Matrix only takes patterns from its pattern cores. Each pattern core provides 36 pattern slots for the Assembler Matrix.

- Assembler Matrix Craft Core

The Assembler Matrix will assign the received crafting jobs to its craft cores. Each craft core can run 8 crafting jobs at the same time.

- Assembler Matrix Speed Core

It acts as the <ItemLink id="ae2:speed_card" /> for the Assembler Matrix. 5 speed cores allow the Assembler Matrix to run at full speed.
Installing more than 5 speed cores won't give an extra speed boost.

## GUI

Right-clicking a formed and online Assembler Matrix will open its GUI.

You can put patterns into it, search patterns, and view how many crafting jobs it is running.
